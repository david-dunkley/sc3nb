    "sc3nb is a python package that offers an interface to SuperCollider3. \n",

    "The goal of sc3nb is to facilitate the programming of auditory displays and interactive sonifications by\n",
    "- teaming up python (and particularly numpy, scipy, pandas, matplotlib etc.) for data science\n",
    "- and SuperCollider3 for interactive real-time sound rendering.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "It currently allows to..\n",
    "\n",
    "- start and control the SuperCollider audio server (scsynth)\n",
    "  - The SuperCollider audio server can be started and addressed via a python SuperCollider Server implementation or via OSC messages directly.\n",
    "  - There are many Python implementations of Classes from SuperCollider like `Synth`, `SynthDef`, `Buffer` and `Bus`\n",
    "\n",
    "- use the SuperCollider language (sclang) interactively via a subprocess\n",
    "  - You can write SuperCollider language code in Jupyter Notebooks and let sclang evaluate it.\n",

    "- audio applications in general such as games or GUI-enhancements\n",

    "- computer music and just in time music control\n",
    "- any usecase that the SuperCollider 3 language supports\n",

    "There are some things to consider when using sc3nb.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- The shortcut `ctrl/cmd + .` does currently only works in classic Jupyter notebooks not in JupyterLab. It also will import sc3nb as `sc3nb` and thus you should avoid variables with the name `sc3nb`.\n",
    "- We depend on the output to stdout of sclang and scsynth in some cases like the startup of the server or more obviously for the sclang output when using cmd with verbosity. This means if some language settings or updates of sclang/scsynth change the outputs to something that we don't expect stuff will fail. However this should be quite easy to patch.\n",
    "- There is a bug in Jupyter (https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter_client/issues/104) that does leave sclang and scsynth running when restarting the Jupyter kernel. However calling `exit()` on the SC instance will kill them. To aviod conflicts with orphaned sclangs/scsynths we also look for leftover sclang/scsynth processes on the start of each and will try to kill them. This might lead to killing sclang or scsynth processes that you wanted to keep. You can specify which parent processes are allowed for sclang/scsynth processes with the `allowed_parents` paramter.\n",
    "- The SuperCollider Objects are currently not guaranteed to be thread safe.\n",
    "- Another thing about SuperCollider in general is to keep in mind that there are limits in the network communication. Currently we only support UDP and therefore have the corresponding limits. As an example a Bundler will fail when you try to send too many messages."
