# sc3nb

sc3nb is a python package that offers an interface to SuperCollider3 (SC3), with special support to be used within jupyter notebooks.

* Documentation: https://interactive-sonification.github.io/sc3nb
* Source code: https://github.com/interactive-sonification/sc3nb
* Bug reports: https://github.com/interactive-sonification/sc3nb/issues


The goal of sc3nb is to facilitate the development of auditory displays and interactive sonifications by teaming up
* python (and particularly numpy, scipy, pandas, matplotlib etc.) for data science
* and SuperCollider3 for interactive real-time sound rendering.
â€‹
It provides:
* SC - a class to interface with the SuperCollider audio server (scsynth) aswell as the SuperCollider Language and Interpreter (sclang)
    * The SuperCollider audio server can be started and addressed via
        * OSC directly with OSC messages and bundles
        * Python implementations of Classes from SuperCollider like `Synth`, `SynthDef`, `Buffer` and `Bus`
    * use the SuperCollider language (sclang) interactively via a subprocess.
        * You can write SuperCollider language code in Jupyter Notebooks and let sclang evaluate it.
        * Inject python variables into your sclang code
        * get the results of the sclang code in python
* helper functions such as linlin, cpsmidi, midicps, clip, ampdb, dbamp which work like their SC3 counterparts.


sc3nb can be used for
* multi-channel audio processing
* auditory display and sonification
* sound synthesis experiment
* audio applications in general such as games or GUI-enhancements
* signal analysis and plotting
* computer music and just-in-time music control
* any usecase that the SuperCollider 3 language supports


It is meant to grow into a backend for a sonification package, and can be used both from jupyter and in standard python software development.

## Installation

- To use sc3nb you need a installation of SuperCollider on your system. See https://supercollider.github.io/download for instructions.
- To install sc3nb you can
  - install it locally in editable mode (i.e. changes to sc3nb code will automatically be "re-installed").
    - clone the repository from https://github.com/interactive-sonification/sc3nb
    - from inside the sc3nb directory run `pip install -e .`
  - or install it directly from GitHub using `pip install git+git://github.com/interactive-sonification/sc3nb@master`
  - we are also currently making sure that sc3nb can also be installed via `pip install sc3nb` from PyPI

## Usage

We provide usage examples in the form of Jupyter notebooks. You see them in the User Guide section of the documentation and also download them from the sc3nb repository [examples folder](https://github.com/interactive-sonification/sc3nb/tree/master/examples)
